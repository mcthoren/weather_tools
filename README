All the tools I use for creating my little weather page here:

In theory, if one wanted to run this themselves, they could change the OVER_DIR
variable, and some of the upload paths, and be off to a good start

This is part of an ongoing project to tinker together a weather station from a
raspberry pi.

The sensor data used to be pretty noisy, this combined with some of the things
that happen to the linux file system on the raspberry pi necessitated the very
strict pattern matching observed toward the top of wx.go.

As the data strings begin with the date, patterns search for strings that start
with 2, in the hopes that I have something better figured out before the year 2999.
The history of computer science suggests that I will not.

* A number of directories need to be created. Inside of $OVER_DIR, do:
	mkdir data plots particle/data/$YEAR particle/plots
	+ Where $YEAR is the 4 digit year.
	+ I use a cronjob to generate a new $YEAR dir every new year at midnight.

* The i2c bus needs to be enabled.  This is probably most easily done with
  raspi-config.  Make sure your user is in the i2c and gpio groups

The Air Quality readings are currently raw data from the bme680, the datasheet
for which can be found here:
