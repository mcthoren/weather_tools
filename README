All the tools I use for creating my little weather page here:

also see http://slackology.net/wxnotes.html for more info

In theory, if one wanted to run this themselves, they could change the OVER_DIR variable, and some of the upload paths, and be off to a good start

This is very much a work in progress, and is part of an ongoing project to tinker together a weather station from a raspberry pi.

The sensor data can sometimes be noisy, this combined with some of the things that happen to the linux file system on the raspberry pi necessitated the very strict pattern matching observed toward the top of wx.go

As the data strings begin with the date, patterns search for strings that start with 2, in the hopes that i have sth better figured out before the year 2999. The history of computer science suggests that I will not.

The sht11 will display humidity over 100%, and sometimes does so when there's a lot of fog and mist around, so the patterns were updated to reflect this.

Prerequisites:

* We need the Adafruit GPIO and BMP python libs, they can be obtained via git like so:
	git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO.git
	git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_BMP.git

	One would then want to hop into their respective directories and do sth like the following:
	sudo python setup.py install

* A number of directories need to be created. Inside of $OVER_DIR, do:
	mkdir data plots particle/data particle/plots

* The i2c bus needs to be enabled.
	prly easiest to use sth like raspi-config and enable it there.
	make sure your user is in the i2c and gpio groups

* The shtx sensor also needs a module, and some help.
	install module from:
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpiSht1x
